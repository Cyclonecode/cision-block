This plugin adds a shortcode and a widget that can be used for pulling and displaying pressreleases from cision.

== Description ==

This plugin is developed by [Cyclonecode](https://profiles.wordpress.org/cyclonecode) and can be used to load and expose press releases made by [Cision](http://www.cision.se/).

To start pulling feed items from cision you first need to add the unique identifier for you json feed at the configuration page for the plugin.
You can also change how many feed items to pull, type of feed items, enable pagination, configure caching and much more.

If you have questions or perhaps some idea on things that should be added you can also try [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cyclonecode/shared_invite/zt-6bdtbdab-n9QaMLM~exHP19zFDPN~AQ).

= Widget =

You can display a feed in any sidebar by adding and configure a widget.

= Shortcode =

The shortcode **[cision-block]** can either be used by adding it to the content field of any post or by using the **do_shortcode** function in one of your templates.

Shortcode attributes:

- id
Assign a specific name for a block.

- source_uid
A unique feed identifier.

- language
The language code for each feed item. For example 'en' for english.

- date_format
The date format to use.

- readmore
The readmore button text.

- count
The maximum number of items to include in the feed.

- view
This states what kind of items to include:
1 - include both regulatory and non-regulatory items.
2 - include only regulatory items.
3 - include only non-regulatory items.

- start
Sets the start date for the feed items. The format to use is 2016-12-31.

- end
Sets the end date for the feed items. The format to use is 2016-12-31.

- items_per_page
Sets the number of feed items to display on each page.

- tags
Only press releases with the specified tag will be included. Multiple tags can be separated with a comma.

- categories
Only press releases that has one or more of the specified categories will be included. Multiple categories can be separated with a comma.

- types
Only press releases of the specified types will be included.

- image_style
The image style to use:

 - DownloadUrl
 - UrlTo100x100ArResized
 - UrlTo200x200ArResized
 - UrlTo400x400ArResized
 - UrlTo800x800ArResized
 - UrlTo100x100Thumbnail
 - UrlTo200x200Thumbnail

- flush
Clears the cache for the block.

Here is an example using all of the above attributes:

`[cision-block id=example_block source_uid=A275C0BF733048FFAE9126ACA64DD08F language=sv date_format=m-d-Y readmore="Read more" view=1 count=6 items_per_page=2 tags="cision,company" categories="New Year,Summer camp" types="PRM, RDV" start=2016-01-12 end=2019-06-12 image_style=UrlTo400x400ArResized flush=true]`

**Notice** that all shortcode attributes are optional and that they **must** be on a single line.
Default values is taken from the plugins settings page.

Here is a complete list of the different kind of pressreleases:

* KMK - Annual Financial statement
* RDV - Annual Report
* PRM - Company Announcement
* RPT - Interim Report
* INB - Invitation
* NBR - Newsletter

= More than one block in a page =

To use more than one block in a single page you will need to set a unique id for each block or else they will both share the same cache entry.

= Template =

The template used to render the feed is **cision-block/templates/cision-block.php**, you can override
this template by copying it to either the root or under a **templates** folder in your theme.

= Experimental: Display single press releases in Wordpress =

Since version 2.0.0 it is possible to fetch and display press releases directly from within Wordpress.
The template used in this case is **cision-block/templates/cision-block-post.php**, you can override
this template by copying it to either the root or under a **templates** folder in your theme.

The `$CisionItem` feed object that is available in the template contains all raw data fetched from Cision.
Under the **Resources** section there is a link that explains all the different fields that is available.
For example if you use the `$CisionItem->HtmlBody` to display content from the feed item you might have to add custom
css since this contains pre formated html which may include inline css and so on.

= Fields =

By default only the following fields are collected for each feed item:

* Title
* Intro
* Body
* PublishDate
* CisionWireUrl
* IsRegulatory
* Images[0]
 * DownloadUrl
 * Description

= Filters =

Add more fields to each feed item:

    add_filter('cision_map_source_item', function($item, $data, $block_id) {
      $item['Header'] = sanitize_text_field($data->Header);
      $item['LogoUrl'] = esc_url_raw($data->LogoUrl);
      $item['SocialMediaPitch'] = sanitize_text_field($data->SocialMediaPitch);

      return $item;
    }, 10, 3);

Customize the sorting of the feed items:

    add_filter('cision_block_sort', function($items, $block_id) {
      usort($items, function($a, $b) {
        return $a->PublishDate > $b->PublishDate;
      });

      return $items;
    }, 10, 2);

Add custom attributes to the pager:

    add_filter('cision_block_pager_attributes', function(array $attributes, $block_id) {
      return array_merge(
        $attributes,
        array(
          'class' => 'custom-class',
          'id' => 'custom-id',
        )
      );
    }, 10, 2);

Set a custom class for active pager item:

    add_filter('cision_block_pager_active_class', function($class, $block_id) {
      return 'custom-class';
    }, 10, 2);

To add attributes to the section wrapper in the template:

    add_filter('cision_block_wrapper_attributes', function(array $attributes, $block_id) {
      return array(
        'class' => array(
          'custom-class',
        ),
      );
    }, 10, 2);

To add attributes to the article wrapper in the template:

    add_filter('cision_block_media_attributes', function(array $attributes, $block_id) {
      return array(
        'class' => array(
          'custom-class',
        ),
      );
    }, 10, 2);

Add a prefix that will be displayed at the start of the wrapper:

    add_filter('cision_block_prefix', function($prefix, $block_id) {
      return '<h1>Prefix</h1>';
    }, 10, 2);

Add a suffix that will be displayed at the end of the wrapper:

    add_filter('cision_block_suffix', function($suffix, $block_id) {
      return '<h1>Suffix</h1>';
    }, 10, 2);


= Resources =

A complete list of fields can be found at: [https://websolutions.ne.cision.com/documents/P2_Feed.pdf](https://websolutions.ne.cision.com/documents/P2_Feed.pdf)

The following Feed identifier can be used for testing: **A275C0BF733048FFAE9126ACA64DD08F**

== Ideas and upcoming features ==

- Add plugin specific css classes to single article page.
- Integrate support for Cision PUSH events.
- Support to fetch feeds in XML format.
- Add "test" button to configuration page. This would check so the feed can be retrieved successfully.
- Support to hide feed items which does not have any picture.
- Add new settings page where the user can select which field to include. This fields will then be available in the themes template file.
- Support to grab the entire feeds, not just the 100 last entries.
- Add checkbox to settings page which can be used to enabled/disable the rendering of shortcode and widget.
- Extended error handling for debug purposes.
- Autoloader.
- Register and use custom posts for each fetched release.

== Installation ==

1. Upload cision block to the **/wp-content/plugins/** directory,
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Possible to have more than 1 identifier? =

There is possible to use separate feed identifiers for different blocks by using the
**source_uid** attribute in the shortcode as in this example:

    [cision-block source_uid=A275C0BF733048FFAE9126ACA64DD08F]

= Possible to create multiple cision blocks? =

Yes it is possible to have multiple blocks by simply adding shortcode arguments for each block.
